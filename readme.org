* Watch Dirs

Watches for modified & created files recursively in a directory and applies actions. In this case we want to change the permissions of files moved there or created to t100:tram with permissions 770.

** systemd

: cp watch_files.service /etc/systemd/system dir

: systemctl start watch_files
