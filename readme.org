* Watch Files

Watches for modified & created files recursively in a directory and applies actions. In this case we want to change the permissions of files moved there or created to USER:GROUP with permissions 770.

ACL didn't work on moved files, normal linux permissions don't seem to affect files which are created in regards to setting the default group.

** Requirements

| ruby | 2.2 or greater                   |
| OS   | Linux, BSD, Mac, ie: Not Windows |

** systemd

Copy the systemd startup service to the system dir

   :END:

- Allow multiple directories with multiple user & groups to be setup and ran in parallel
- Use ruby libraries instead of system calls to chmod and chown for greater compatibility with other systems
- Add tests
